Your surveys:(Student Page -- Group Member Evaluations)
* Need to have surveys pulled from the database. 
* When a professor makes a survey, it needs to be put in the database. 
* Then that survey needs to be able to be pulled from it and added to the student page when they go to complete the survey. 
* Needs a create new survey button with the appropriate functionality to go with it.

  You then click in that course it will have the list of group members with the evaluation you gave to them.

* Same notes as teacher view with it pulling from db.
When students go to fill out a survey after clicking on a class:
	* Clean it up.
	* Grab it from the database.
	* The submission needs go into the database.
	* The students that they can evaluate need to only be pulled from the group they were in. 
		Pull only students in their group
	* Needs validation so it can’t be submitted without being fully filled out. Right now it creates an error message.
